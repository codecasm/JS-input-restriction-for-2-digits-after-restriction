JS input restriction for 2 digits after restriction

# NOTE
<p>1. need to apply validations for keys like: <strong>'-','+','e',</strong> etc.</p>
        <p>2. purposefully input type is kept to <strong>text</strong>, because <strong>number</strong> won't work
            perfectly till the validation not done mentioned in <strong>point 1</strong>.</p>
        <p>3. it also accepts more than 1 decimal, it also lac due to validation</p>
